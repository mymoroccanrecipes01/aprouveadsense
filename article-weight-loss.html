        <h2>Why Crash Diets Always Fail</h2>
        <p>We've all seen them — the "10-day detox," the "eat 800 calories a day" plan, the "cut out all carbs forever" approach. And we've probably all tried at least one. The problem is simple: extreme restriction is not sustainable. Your body fights back. Your hunger increases. Your willpower runs out. And when the diet ends, the weight comes right back — sometimes more than you lost.</p>
        <p>Research consistently shows that approximately 95% of people who lose weight through extreme dieting regain it within 1–2 years. The approach is fundamentally flawed.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The real goal isn't just losing weight — it's losing weight and keeping it off.</strong> That requires a strategy your body and lifestyle can sustain indefinitely, not one that lasts two weeks.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Science: Calorie Deficit</h2>
        <p>Weight loss comes down to one core principle: burning more calories than you consume. This is called a calorie deficit. It's not glamorous, but it's the foundation of every successful weight loss plan — regardless of what specific diet you follow.</p>
        <p>One pound (0.45 kg) of body fat stores approximately 3,500 calories. So to lose one pound per week, you need a deficit of about 500 calories per day. That's it. No secret formula — just consistent math.</p>

        <h2>How Big Should Your Deficit Be?</h2>
        <p>This is where most people go wrong. They think "more deficit = faster results = better." But a deficit that's too large causes muscle loss, hormonal disruption, extreme fatigue, and intense cravings that derail your progress.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mild deficit (200–300 cal/day):</strong> Very sustainable. Lose about 0.2–0.3 kg per week. Minimal side effects. Great for long-term results.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate deficit (300–500 cal/day):</strong> The sweet spot for most people. Lose about 0.3–0.5 kg per week. Manageable hunger levels.</li>
          <li><strong>Aggressive deficit (500+ cal/day):</strong> Can work short-term, but increases the risk of muscle loss and burnout. Not recommended for extended periods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Create a Sustainable Plan</h2>
        <h3>1. Calculate Your Maintenance Calories</h3>
        <p>Your maintenance level is how many calories you need to eat to stay at your current weight. Use an online TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) calculator — you'll need your age, gender, height, weight, and activity level.</p>

        <h3>2. Subtract 300–500 Calories</h3>
        <p>That's your daily target. For example, if your maintenance is 2,200 calories, aim for 1,700–1,900 per day.</p>

        <h3>3. Don't Cut Everything at Once</h3>
        <p>Instead of overhauling your entire diet, look for easy wins. Swap a sugary drink for water (saves 150+ calories). Use a smaller plate. Cook at home instead of ordering out. These small changes compound over time.</p>

        <h3>4. Prioritize Protein</h3>
        <p>When you're in a deficit, protein becomes even more important. It preserves muscle mass, keeps you full, and supports your metabolism. Aim for at least 1.2–1.6g per kg of body weight.</p>

        <h3>5. Don't Forget Exercise — But Don't Rely on It Alone</h3>
        <p>Exercise is great for health, mood, and body composition. But it's surprisingly difficult to "burn off" calories through exercise alone. A 30-minute jog burns about 300 calories — the same as a handful of nuts and a yogurt. Diet is where the real leverage is.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The winning combo:</strong> A moderate calorie deficit (from diet) combined with regular strength training preserves muscle while you lose fat. This is the approach that produces the best long-term results.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Dealing With Hunger and Cravings</h2>
        <p>Hunger will happen. It's normal. But there are smart ways to manage it without breaking your plan:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eat high-fiber foods (vegetables, oats, legumes) — they slow digestion and keep you fuller longer.</li>
          <li>Drink water before meals. Thirst is often mistaken for hunger.</li>
          <li>Eat slowly and chew thoroughly. It takes 20 minutes for your brain to register fullness.</li>
          <li>Don't skip meals. Spread your calories across 3–4 meals to keep energy stable.</li>
          <li>Allow yourself small treats. Rigid "all or nothing" thinking is a fast track to giving up.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Long Will It Take?</h2>
        <p>At a moderate deficit, expect to lose about 1–2 kg per month. After 3 months, that's 3–6 kg. It's not as dramatic as a crash diet's first two weeks — but it's real, it sticks, and it doesn't destroy your metabolism in the process.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Sustainable weight loss is boring. It's not a 10-day miracle. It's a consistent, moderate calorie deficit, combined with enough protein, regular movement, and the patience to let time do its work. Use tools like Pin Recipes to stay aware of what you're eating, and trust the process.</p>
