        <h2>Why Protein Matters So Much</h2>
        <p>Protein is the building block of your body. It repairs muscle tissue, produces enzymes and hormones, supports your immune system, and keeps you feeling full after meals. Of the three macronutrients, protein is the one most people consistently under-eat — and the one that makes the biggest difference in how you feel and look.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The satiety factor:</strong> Protein is by far the most filling macronutrient. Studies show that increasing protein intake from 15% to 30% of total calories can cut snacking and overall calorie intake significantly — without you even trying.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Much Protein Do You Actually Need?</h2>
        <p>The baseline recommendation from health authorities is about 0.8g per kilogram of body weight per day. But that's the minimum to prevent deficiency — not the amount for optimal health or body composition.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sedentary adults:</strong> 0.8–1.0g per kg of body weight</li>
          <li><strong>Moderately active:</strong> 1.2–1.6g per kg</li>
          <li><strong>Athletes or those lifting weights:</strong> 1.6–2.2g per kg</li>
          <li><strong>Older adults (60+):</strong> 1.0–1.2g per kg (muscle preservation becomes more important)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a 70 kg moderately active person, that's roughly 85–110g of protein per day. Sounds like a lot? It's easier to hit than you think.</p>

        <h2>The Best Protein Sources</h2>
        <h3>Animal-Based</h3>
        <p>Chicken breast is the classic — about 31g of protein per 100g cooked, with very little fat. Eggs are incredibly versatile at 13g per 100g. Salmon gives you protein <em>and</em> healthy omega-3 fats. Greek yogurt packs 10g per 100g and works perfectly as a snack or breakfast base.</p>

        <h3>Plant-Based</h3>
        <p>Lentils and chickpeas are powerhouses — about 9g of protein per 100g cooked, plus tons of fiber. Tofu is surprisingly good at 8g per 100g and takes on whatever flavor you cook it with. Nuts and nut butters add protein in small, calorie-dense doses.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Mixing sources matters:</strong> Plant proteins are often "incomplete" — meaning they lack one or more essential amino acids. Combining different plant sources (like rice and beans) throughout the day fills those gaps naturally.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Easy Ways to Add More Protein to Your Day</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start your morning with it.</strong> Greek yogurt with berries, or scrambled eggs with spinach — both give you 15–20g before lunch.</li>
          <li><strong>Add it to snacks.</strong> Cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, or a handful of nuts between meals.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't forget your drinks.</strong> Blending protein powder or Greek yogurt into smoothies is an easy, invisible boost.</li>
          <li><strong>Upgrade your lunch.</strong> Swap a plain sandwich for one with grilled chicken or tuna. Add chickpeas to your salad.</li>
          <li><strong>Cook in batches.</strong> Prep a big batch of chicken or lentils on the weekend and use them across multiple meals all week.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Myths About Protein</h2>
        <p><strong>"Too much protein damages your kidneys."</strong> This myth persists, but research shows that high protein intake is safe for people with healthy kidneys. The concern only applies to individuals who already have kidney disease.</p>
        <p><strong>"You need protein immediately after a workout."</strong> The "anabolic window" myth has been largely debunked. What matters is your total daily protein intake, not the exact timing. Getting protein within a few hours is fine.</p>
        <p><strong>"Plant protein is inferior."</strong> It can be — but only if you rely on a single source. A varied plant-based diet provides all the amino acids you need.</p>

        <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
        <p>Eating high in protein doesn't have to mean grilling chicken every single meal. Mix your sources, plan your meals around a protein anchor, and use tools like CaloriFuel to check whether you're hitting your targets. Small, consistent changes add up to big results.</p>
