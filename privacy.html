      <p>
        Pin Recipes may display advertisements served by third-party advertising networks, including but not limited
        to <strong>Google AdSense</strong>. These networks may use cookies and web beacons to deliver targeted
        advertisements based on your browsing interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collection of data by these third-party services is governed by their own privacy policies. We
        encourage you to review Google's Privacy Policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/privacy</a>
        for more details on how Google handles your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not have access to or control over any data collected by third-party advertising networks beyond
        what is described in this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We may use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to understand how visitors interact with the Site.
        These tools collect anonymized, aggregated data about site traffic and usage. The data collected is used
        only to improve the Site and is not linked to any personal identity.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take the security of your information seriously. We implement appropriate technical and organizational
        measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of your data. However, no
        method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain automatically collected information (such as server logs) for a limited period, typically no
        more than 30 days, after which it is automatically deleted. Any personal information provided through
        contact forms is retained only as long as necessary to respond to your inquiry, and is then deleted.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Pin Recipes is a general-purpose nutrition tool and is not specifically directed at children under the age
