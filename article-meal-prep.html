        <h2>Why Meal Prep Is a Game Changer</h2>
        <p>Think about your worst food decisions. Chances are, most of them happened when you were tired, rushed, or hungry with nothing ready to eat. That's when the fast food drive-through or the vending machine becomes very appealing. Meal prep solves this problem completely.</p>
        <p>By spending 1–2 hours on a Sunday afternoon, you can set yourself up with healthy, balanced meals for the entire week. No decision fatigue. No scrambling at lunchtime. Just open the fridge, grab a container, and go.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The stats are clear:</strong> People who meal prep tend to eat fewer total calories, consume more vegetables, and make healthier choices overall compared to those who decide what to eat on the spot.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What to Prep (and What Not to)</h2>
        <h3>Prep These (They Store Great)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grains:</strong> Rice, quinoa, oats — all keep well in the fridge for 4–5 days.</li>
          <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> Grilled chicken, hard-boiled eggs, cooked lentils, and baked salmon stay fresh for 3–4 days.</li>
          <li><strong>Chopped vegetables:</strong> Bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, and spinach can be pre-cut and stored in containers.</li>
          <li><strong>Sauces and dressings:</strong> Make a big batch of vinaigrette or marinade and store in a jar.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Don't Prep These (They Go Soggy or Stale)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Salad greens mixed with dressing (keep dressing separate).</li>
          <li>Avocado (browns quickly — slice right before eating).</li>
          <li>Toast or bread (goes stale fast — prep the filling, not the bread).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Sunday Prep Workflow</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1 — Plan your meals.</strong> Decide what you'll eat Monday through Friday. Keep it simple: 2–3 different proteins, 2–3 grains, and a variety of vegetables. Mix and match throughout the week.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2 — Grocery shop Saturday.</strong> Buy everything you need. Having the ingredients on hand is half the battle.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3 — Cook in parallel.</strong> Put rice in the cooker, chicken in the oven, and boil eggs at the same time. Chop vegetables while things cook. The whole process takes about 60–90 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4 — Portion and store.</strong> Divide everything into single-serving containers. Label them if you want — or just remember what's what.</p>

        <h2>Keeping Meals Interesting</h2>
        <p>The number one reason people stop meal prepping is boredom. Eating the same thing every day gets old fast. Here's how to keep it fresh:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Use different sauces.</strong> The same chicken and rice tastes completely different with teriyaki sauce on Monday vs. lemon-herb on Wednesday.</li>
          <li><strong>Rotate proteins.</strong> Don't cook just chicken. Do salmon one week, turkey the next, lentils the week after.</li>
          <li><strong>Mix up the veggies.</strong> Roasted vegetables one day, raw and crunchy the next.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't prep everything.</strong> Prep the base (grains, protein), but assemble the actual meals fresh each day. It feels less monotonous.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Storage Tips</h2>
        <p>Glass containers are better than plastic for reheating. Keep everything in the fridge for up to 4 days — anything beyond that should go in the freezer. Always let hot food cool before sealing and refrigerating.</p>

        <h2>Calculate Your Prep Meals with Pin Recipes</h2>
        <p>Before you cook, use Pin Recipes to calculate the calories and macros of each meal you're planning to prep. That way, you know exactly what you're eating when you open that container on a busy Wednesday afternoon. No guessing, no stress.</p>
