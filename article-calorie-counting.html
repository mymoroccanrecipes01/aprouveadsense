        <h2>What Is a Calorie, Exactly?</h2>
        <p>A calorie is simply a unit of energy. When we talk about food calories (technically kilocalories), we're talking about how much energy your body gets from eating that food. A banana has about 105 calories. A slice of pizza might have 300. Your body burns calories just by existing — breathing, thinking, keeping your heart beating — and burns more when you move.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> If you eat more calories than you burn, you gain weight. If you eat fewer, you lose weight. Everything in nutrition comes back to this simple equation.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why People Count Calories</h2>
        <p>Calorie counting isn't about restriction or punishment. It's about <em>awareness</em>. Most people have no idea how many calories they actually consume in a day. A "healthy" smoothie from a café might have 600 calories. A restaurant portion of pasta could be double what you think. Counting gives you clarity.</p>
        <p>Common reasons people track calories include wanting to lose weight gradually, understanding portion sizes better, planning meals around fitness goals, or simply becoming more mindful about what they eat.</p>

        <h2>How to Get Started</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Figure Out Your Daily Calorie Needs</h3>
        <p>Before you start counting what you eat, you need to know your target. Your body has a "maintenance level" — the number of calories it needs to stay at your current weight. This depends on your age, gender, height, weight, and activity level.</p>
        <p>A rough estimate: multiply your weight in pounds by 15 if you're moderately active. That gives you a ballpark daily maintenance number. For more precise numbers, look into the Mifflin-St Jeor equation online.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Set a Realistic Goal</h3>
        <p>If you want to lose weight, aim for a deficit of 300–500 calories per day below your maintenance level. This translates to roughly 0.3–0.5 kg of weight loss per week — slow, sustainable, and actually achievable. Anything more than that and you risk muscle loss, fatigue, and burnout.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Start Logging What You Eat</h3>
        <p>You don't need a fancy app — though they can help. The simplest method: write down everything you eat, estimate the portion size, and look up the calorie count. Tools like Pin Recipes make this much faster, especially for home-cooked meals where you know the exact ingredients.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don't try to be perfect on day one. Just log for a few days to build the habit. Accuracy improves naturally with practice.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Forgetting drinks.</strong> A latte, juice, or sweetened coffee can add 200–500 calories without you realizing it.</li>
          <li><strong>Underestimating portion sizes.</strong> Restaurant servings are often 2–3x what a "standard" serving actually is.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring cooking oils and sauces.</strong> A tablespoon of olive oil is 120 calories. Sauces add up fast.</li>
          <li><strong>Obsessing over every gram.</strong> Calorie counting is a tool, not a religion. Being within 100–200 calories of your target is totally fine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Long Should You Count?</h2>
        <p>Most nutrition experts suggest tracking for 2–4 weeks to build awareness. After that, many people develop a solid intuition for portions and can maintain their goals without logging every single meal. Some people enjoy the structure and keep going — that's fine too, as long as it doesn't become stressful.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>Calorie counting is one of the most effective tools for understanding your diet. It doesn't have to be complicated, and it doesn't have to take over your life. Start simple, stay consistent, and use tools like Pin Recipes to make the process faster and more accurate.</p>
