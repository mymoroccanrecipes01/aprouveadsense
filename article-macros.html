        <h2>What Are Macronutrients?</h2>
        <p>Macronutrients — often shortened to "macros" — are the three main nutrients your body needs in large quantities. Every single food you eat contains some combination of them. They are the source of all the calories you consume, and each one plays a distinct role in keeping your body running.</p>
        <p>The three macros are: <strong>Protein</strong>, <strong>Carbohydrates</strong>, and <strong>Fat</strong>. Let's break down each one.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Calorie math made simple:</strong> Protein = 4 kcal/g. Carbs = 4 kcal/g. Fat = 9 kcal/g. These numbers tell you exactly how many calories each gram of a macronutrient contributes to your total intake.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Protein: The Builder</h2>
        <p>Protein is your body's primary repair and construction material. It's made up of amino acids — 20 in total, 9 of which your body can't produce on its own (these are "essential" amino acids that must come from food).</p>
        <p>Protein supports muscle growth and repair, produces hormones and enzymes, strengthens your immune system, and is the most satiating macronutrient — meaning it keeps you full the longest.</p>
        <p><strong>Best sources:</strong> Chicken, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, lentils, tofu, nuts, and cottage cheese.</p>
        <p><strong>Daily target:</strong> 0.8–2.0g per kg of body weight, depending on activity level.</p>

        <h2>Carbohydrates: The Fuel</h2>
        <p>Carbs are your body's preferred source of quick energy. When you eat carbs, they're broken down into glucose, which enters your bloodstream and powers everything from your muscles to your brain.</p>
        <p>Not all carbs are equal, though. <strong>Complex carbs</strong> (oats, brown rice, sweet potatoes) break down slowly and provide steady, sustained energy. <strong>Simple carbs</strong> (white sugar, white bread) cause rapid blood sugar spikes followed by crashes.</p>
        <p><strong>Best sources:</strong> Oats, brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, fruits, and vegetables.</p>
        <p><strong>Daily target:</strong> Varies widely based on activity. Active individuals need more; sedentary people need less. Focus on quality over quantity.</p>

        <h2>Fat: The Regulator</h2>
        <p>Fat has gotten a bad reputation over the decades, but it's absolutely essential for life. It protects your organs, insulates your body, helps produce hormones (including sex hormones), and is critical for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).</p>
        <p>Fat is also the most calorie-dense macro at 9 kcal per gram — so a little goes a long way. The key is choosing the right kinds.</p>
        <p><strong>Best sources:</strong> Olive oil, avocado, nuts, seeds, fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), and eggs.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Trans fats and excessive saturated fats from fried foods and processed snacks.</p>

        <h2>How to Find Your Macro Balance</h2>
        <p>There's no single "perfect" macro ratio for everyone. It depends on your goals, activity level, and personal preferences. Here are some common starting points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>General health:</strong> 30% protein / 40% carbs / 30% fat</li>
          <li><strong>Fat loss:</strong> 35–40% protein / 30–35% carbs / 25–30% fat (higher protein helps preserve muscle)</li>
          <li><strong>Muscle building:</strong> 30% protein / 45–50% carbs / 20–25% fat (more carbs fuel workouts)</li>
          <li><strong>Endurance athletes:</strong> 25% protein / 55% carbs / 20% fat (carbs are king for stamina)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Do I Need to Track Macros?</h2>
        <p>Not necessarily. If you're eating a balanced diet with plenty of whole foods, you're probably hitting a reasonable macro split without thinking about it. Macro tracking becomes more useful when you have specific goals — like building muscle, losing fat while preserving lean mass, or optimizing athletic performance.</p>
        <p>CaloriFuel shows you a real-time macro breakdown as you build your recipes, so you can see exactly where your calories are coming from without obsessing over it.</p>
