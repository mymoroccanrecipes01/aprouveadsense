        <h2>Why Labels Are So Confusing</h2>
        <p>Nutrition labels look intimidating. They're covered in numbers, percentages, and terms like "Daily Value" that most people have never looked up. Food companies aren't exactly incentivized to make them easy to understand — after all, if you knew exactly how much sugar was in that "healthy" granola bar, you might put it back on the shelf.</p>
        <p>The good news: once you know the system, reading a label takes about 30 seconds. This guide breaks it down into a simple, repeatable process.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>The #1 rule:</strong> Always check the serving size first. Everything else on the label — calories, fat, sugar — is per that serving. If the bag says 2 servings and you eat the whole bag, double every number.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The 5 Numbers That Actually Matter</h2>

        <h3>1. Serving Size &amp; Servings Per Container</h3>
        <p>This is at the very top of the label, and it's the most important thing to check. A serving of cereal might be ¾ cup — but you probably pour 2 cups into your bowl. That means you're actually eating almost 3 servings, and all the calories and nutrients should be multiplied by 3.</p>

        <h3>2. Total Calories</h3>
        <p>This number tells you exactly how much energy one serving of this food provides. It's the single most useful number on the label for weight management. Everything else gives you context about the quality of those calories — but this number is the bottom line.</p>

        <h3>3. Total Fat, Saturated Fat &amp; Trans Fat</h3>
        <p>Total fat is the big number. Below it, you'll see a breakdown: saturated fat (limit this — found in fried foods and processed meats) and trans fat (avoid entirely — it's linked to heart disease). A small amount of fat per serving is totally fine; it's the saturated and trans fats that deserve your attention.</p>

        <h3>4. Total Carbohydrates &amp; Sugars</h3>
        <p>Total carbs include fiber, starches, and sugars. The number you want to pay the most attention to is <strong>sugars</strong> — specifically, look for "Added Sugars" if it's listed. Natural sugars (from fruit, for example) are less concerning than added sugars from sweeteners and syrups.</p>

        <h3>5. Protein</h3>
        <p>This tells you how much protein is in one serving. It's especially important if you're trying to increase your protein intake or evaluate whether a snack will actually keep you full.</p>

        <h2>What About the Percentages?</h2>
        <p>The "% Daily Value" column on the right side of the label tells you what percentage of your recommended daily intake of that nutrient one serving provides. A quick rule of thumb: 5% or less is "low," and 20% or more is "high."</p>
        <p>This is useful for nutrients you want more of (like fiber and protein) and nutrients you want less of (like saturated fat and added sugars).</p>

        <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sugar listed as the 2nd or 3rd ingredient.</strong> Ingredients are listed by quantity — if sugar is near the top, it's a major component of the product.</li>
          <li><strong>A long list of unrecognizable ingredients.</strong> If you can't pronounce half the words, it's a heavily processed food.</li>
          <li><strong>"Per serving" is suspiciously small.</strong> Some companies make the serving size tiny so the calorie count looks impressive. Always check.</li>
          <li><strong>Claims like "light" or "healthy" on the packaging.</strong> These are marketing terms. Always read the actual label behind the claim.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Putting It Into Practice</h2>
        <p>Next time you're at the grocery store, pick up a product and run through these five steps: check the serving size, note the calories, glance at fat and sugar, and check the protein. It takes seconds. Do it for a week, and it becomes automatic.</p>
        <p>For home-cooked meals where there's no label, that's exactly what CaloriFuel is for — enter your ingredients, and it calculates everything for you in real time.</p>
