      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At CaloriFuel, we believe that understanding what you eat should never be complicated or costly.
        Our mission is to provide a free, reliable, and beautifully designed tool that helps anyone — from
        home cooks to professional chefs — understand the nutritional value of their recipes in seconds.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        Tracking calories is one of the simplest ways to make informed decisions about your health and diet.
        Yet most existing tools are cluttered, require expensive subscriptions, or demand you create an account
        just to get a basic number. We wanted to change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        CaloriFuel was created to be the go-to, no-fuss recipe calorie calculator. You type an ingredient,
        pick a quantity, and instantly see the calories and macronutrients. No sign-up. No paywall. No clutter.
      </p>

      <h2>How Our Data Works</h2>
      <p>
        Our ingredient database is built using nutritional data sourced from widely recognized food composition
        references, including the USDA FoodData Central database. All values are given per 100 grams and are
        automatically scaled based on the quantity and unit you enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        We regularly review and update our database to ensure accuracy. That said, nutritional values can vary
        slightly depending on the brand, preparation method, and origin of the ingredient. Always consult a
        healthcare professional for precise dietary guidance.
      </p>

      <h2>Who's Behind CaloriFuel?</h2>
      <p>
        CaloriFuel is an independent project built by a small team of web developers and nutrition enthusiasts
        who are passionate about making healthy living more accessible. We are based internationally and are
        committed to creating tools that are genuinely useful to people around the world.
      </p>
